## Week 7 code example

This is our second Angular code example. It  illustrates the binding and event topics for this week within an Angular application that utilizes client-side routing.

Once again, to ensure that this example functions, please remember to run the command while in the directory/folder that has the `package.json` file:

```
npm i
```
