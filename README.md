## WEB422 code examples

Organized by week. Each "week" page has a README file that describes that week's code examples.

You can browse the code online.

You can also download the repository as a zip file.

Or, you can clone the repository to your own computer.

**NOTE** An updated set of Code examples has replaced the old "Code Examples 2020". The old "Code Examples" has been depricated and will be removed in future versions of this course.
