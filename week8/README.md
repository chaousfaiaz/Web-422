## Week 8 code examples

This week we have included two separate examples:

* **week8-app:** This app illustrates how to add a simple service that returns static data, as well as data from a public Web API using HttpClient

* **week8-app-routing:** This app illustrates how routing with parameters works in Angular.  It also expands upon the service created in "week8-app" 

Once again, to ensure that this example functions, please remember to run the command while in the directory/folder that has the `package.json` file:

```
npm i
```
